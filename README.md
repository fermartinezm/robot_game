GAME DESCRIPTION:

- The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop,
  of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.
- There are no other obstructions on the table surface.
- The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but cannot fall.
  Any movement that would result in the robot falling from the table is
  prevented, however further valid movement commands are still allowed.



INSTRUCTIONS:

Commands:

  - PLACE X,Y,F
  - MOVE
  - LEFT
  - RIGHT
  - REPORT


Explanation:

  - PLACE will put the toy robot on the table in position X,Y and facing
    NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST.
  - MOVE will move the toy robot one unit forward in the direction it is
    currently facing.
  - LEFT and RIGHT will rotate the robot 90 degrees in the specified
    direction without changing the position of the robot.
  - REPORT will announce the X,Y and F of the robot.
  - The origin (0,0) is the SOUTH WEST most corner.
  - The first valid command to the robot is a PLACE command, after that, any
    sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, including another
    PLACE command. The application discard all commands in the sequence
    until a valid PLACE command has been executed.
